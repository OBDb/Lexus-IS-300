generations:
  - name: "First Generation (XE10)"
    start_year: 2000
    end_year: 2005
    description: "The original Lexus IS 300 introduced the IS line to North America, targeting the BMW 3 Series with its sports sedan dynamics and distinctive styling. Powered by the 2JZ-GE 3.0-liter inline-six engine (shared with the Supra but naturally aspirated) producing 215 horsepower and 218 lb-ft of torque. Initially available only with a five-speed automatic transmission, a five-speed manual option was added in 2002 for driving enthusiasts. The exterior featured unique styling with clear taillight housings (inspiring the 'Altezza lights' aftermarket trend) and a driver-focused interior with chronograph-inspired gauge cluster. The SportCross wagon variant was introduced in 2002, offering additional utility while maintaining the sedan's sporting character. Handling was prioritized with double-wishbone suspension front and rear, achieving a near-perfect weight distribution. Limited-run special editions included the L-Tuned models with enhanced performance modifications. The first-generation IS 300 established Lexus's credibility in the sport sedan segment, offering Japanese reliability with engaging driving dynamics at a competitive price point."

  - name: "Second Generation (XE20) IS 250/350"
    start_year: 2006
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The IS 300 nameplate was temporarily retired during the second generation of the IS lineup, replaced by the IS 250 and IS 350 models with new 2.5L and 3.5L V6 engines respectively. The IS 250 produced 204 horsepower while the more powerful IS 350 delivered 306 horsepower, both featuring direct and port injection. This generation established a more distinctive Lexus design language and offered significantly improved interior quality with luxury features more aligned with the Lexus brand identity. Both manual and automatic transmissions were available, though the manual was limited to the lower-powered IS 250 model."

  - name: "Third Generation (XE30)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The IS 300 nameplate returned for the third generation, though in a different form than the original. For rear-wheel drive models, the IS 300 briefly featured a detuned 3.5L V6 before being replaced by a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 241 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive IS 300 models used a 3.5L V6 producing 260 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic. The exterior featured Lexus's now-signature spindle grille design with aggressive styling and angular LED lighting elements. Inside, the cabin offered improved materials, advanced technology features, and the Lexus Remote Touch controller interface. The F Sport package provided sportier styling, bolstered seats, and suspension tuning. A significant refresh in 2017 brought even more aggressive styling, standard Lexus Safety System+ with pre-collision braking, lane departure alert, and adaptive cruise control, and an updated infotainment system featuring a 10.3-inch display on navigation-equipped models. This version of the IS 300 represented a middle ground in the IS lineup, offering more power than entry-level models in other markets while remaining more accessible than the IS 350."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (XE40)"
    start_year: 2021
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth generation IS 300 continues as a mid-range option in the IS lineup, with a similar powertrain strategy to the previous generation. Rear-wheel drive models are powered by a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 241 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive variants retain a 3.5L V6 producing 260 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, mated to a six-speed automatic. Built on a revised platform focused on handling improvements with increased structural rigidity and optimized suspension components. The exterior styling evolved with a larger spindle grille, slimmer headlights, and a full-width taillight bar. The interior features an updated infotainment system with a standard 8-inch or available 10.3-inch touchscreen positioned closer to the driver for easier access, replacing the previous Remote Touch controller. Standard safety technology expanded with Lexus Safety System+ 2.5, including enhanced pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, emergency steering assist, and all-speed dynamic radar cruise control. The available F Sport package adds distinctive styling elements, sport-tuned suspension, and unique interior appointments. This generation of the IS 300 builds upon the model's foundation as a sports sedan with improved driving dynamics while updating technology and safety features to meet contemporary expectations."
